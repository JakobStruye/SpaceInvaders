Building the project
--------------------

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

The executable is named SpaceInvaders

Note that the project requires the SFML library to build! (v2.x)



Documentation
----------------------------------

See Report.pdf in /docs for the report on this project (in Dutch).
See Manual.pdf in /docs for the documentation generated by Doxygen.
See Design.pdf in /docs for a diagram of the design of the data model.

The doxyfile is included, so it's possible to generate additional documentation.



Gameplay
--------

You control the ship at the bottom of the screen. You can move left and right and shoot. 
Try to shoot all the Alien Ships above you before they reach your shields (or you, if the shields are destroyed).
Destroying Alien Ships gets you 10 to 40 points a piece!
Occasionally a fast red Bonus Ship will appear at the top of the screen. Try to shoot it for an additional 100 points!
If you manage to destroy all Alien Ships, a new level will start, where the Aliens move and shoot faster.
Good luck!



Controls
--------

Moving the Player Ship: left and right arrow keys
Shooting: Space bar
Pausing the game: Escape
Unpausing the game: Enter
Starting a new game after a game over: Enter
Closing the game after a game over: Escape



Advanced features
-----------------

Advanced users can change variables to change the flow of the game. 
Scroll to the bottom of the /src/Model/spaceInvadersModel.h file and tweak the indicated variables.
Don't forget to recompile!
Be careful; if you don't know what you're doing, you might make the game unplayable (or more fun?)...
